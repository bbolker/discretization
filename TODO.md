# To do

- add: Why are we not evaluating multiple competing hypotheses in ecology and evolution?
Betini GS, Avgar T, Fryxell JM. R Soc Open Sci. 2017 Jan; 4(1):160756

- **Clarify**

- CrossValidated post on "no free lunch" principle for coverage of shrinkage estimators?
    - early results suggest no CI advantage for e.g. ridge regression
	- Turek results show undercoverage
	- ... but Burnham et al. get 'adequate' coverage
- More sims?
- Why would we expect different (better/worse) performance from penalized regression vs MA?  (What are their loss functions?)
- check Kabaila et al quote

- ideas for the talk:
    - what do we want to do? (predict, infer, test, quantify importance ...)
	- importance measures: AIC weights, variance explained, R^2, scaled variance, ...
	- examples of people using and misusing discrete comparisons: Luttbeg et al., Ponciano and Taper model averaging, evidentiary stats, etc.
	- examples of people taking discrete models seriously?
	- thinking about *what* before thinking about *how*
