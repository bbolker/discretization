# To do

- **Clarify**
- CrossValidated post on "no free lunch" principle for coverage of shrinkage estimators?
    - early results suggest no CI advantage for e.g. ridge regression
	- Turek results show undercoverage
	- ... but Burnham et al. get 'adequate' coverage
- More sims?
- Why would we expect different (better/worse) performance from penalized regression vs MA?  (What are their loss functions?)
