\abstract{
  Information-theoretic (IT) and multi-model averaging (MMA) statistical
approaches are widely used but suboptimal tools for pursuing a
multifactorial approach (also known as the method of multiple working
hypotheses) in ecology. (1) Conceptually, IT encourages ecologists to
perform tests on sets of artificial models. (2) MMA improves on IT model
selection by implementing a simple form of \emph{shrinkage estimation}
(a way to make accurate predictions from a model with many parameters,
by ``shrinking'' parameter estimates toward zero). However, other
shrinkage estimators such as penalized regression or Bayesian
hierarchical models with regularizing priors are more computationally
efficient and better supported theoretically. (3) In general the
procedures for extracting confidence intervals from MMA are
overconfident, giving overly narrow intervals. If researchers want to
accurately estimate the strength of multiple competing ecological
processes along with reliable confidence intervals, the current best
approach is to use full (maximal) statistical models (possibly with
Bayesian priors) after making principled, \emph{a priori} decisions
about which predictors to include.

\section{How to Use this Template}

The template details the sections that can be used in a manuscript. Note that the order and names of article sections may differ from the requirements of the journal (e.g., the positioning of the Materials and Methods section). Please check the instructions on the authors' page of the journal to verify the correct order and names. For any questions, please contact the editorial office of the journal or support@mdpi.com. For LaTeX-related questions please contact latex@mdpi.com.%\endnote{This is an endnote.} % To use endnotes, please un-comment \printendnotes below (before References). Only journal Laws uses \footnote.

% The order of the section titles is different for some journals. Please refer to the "Instructions for Authors‚Äù on the journal homepage.

\section{Introduction}

The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research. Citing a journal paper \cite{ref-journal}. Now citing a book reference \cite{ref-book1,ref-book2} or other reference types \cite{ref-unpublish,ref-communication,ref-proceeding}. Please use the command \citep{ref-thesis,ref-url} for the following MDPI journals, which use author--date citation: Administrative Sciences, Arts, Econometrics, Economies, Genealogy, Humanities, IJFS, Journal of Intelligence, Journalism and Media, JRFM, Languages, Laws, Religions, Risks, Social Sciences, Literature.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Materials and Methods}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly avail-able database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

\section{Results}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.
\subsection{Subsection}
\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

Bulleted lists look like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item	First bullet;
\item	Second bullet;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}

Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted from the perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}

This section is not mandatory, but can be added to the manuscript if the discussion is unusually long or complex.
